# üçØ Slots

Simply put , slots are spaces on the page. A page can have multiple slots. They are of 2 types

1. **Widget slot** : The slot will contain something that is visible to the human eye. So a widget slot can have 'UI Components'. For eg a widget slot can have a typography widget, that can be added to show text on the page. &#x20;
2. **Logical slot :** The slot will not contain anything visible but will contain more slots as children and act as their parents in the DOM. It's like a container, it can have more slots as its children.\
   Things that we need to apply to all the children's can be added to this parent logical slot.

_<mark style="background-color:orange;">Note: All the widget slots will be housed within a logical page‚Äôs boundaries and adjusted accordingly.</mark>_
