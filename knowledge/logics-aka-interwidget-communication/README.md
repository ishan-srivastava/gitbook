# âœˆ Logics (aka Interwidget Communication)

There are scenarios in which you would want to change data of  [slots.md](../terminology/slots.md "mention"), programatically. \
For instance : \
When I click a the submit button, I would want the spinner to show up.\
When an API is success, I would like to show the data, or else I would want to show the error screen, with the message.

At it's core, Logic is a set of information.\
It has following components :&#x20;

1. The source of the data.
2. The recipient of the data.
3. The data itself.
4. Trigger for the initiating the data transfer.
