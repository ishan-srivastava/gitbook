*   ### Let's start with the logic part.

    Here is what we would want to do
* Add a trigger to the submit button  _"Submit Api Trigger"_ , as we know this will give the feature of for data submission to a API.
* After the submit, \
  a. If success, we would like to show the message from the API in the typography widget.\
  b. If failed we would like to show "FORM SUBMIT FAILED", message.
* Let's make a logic set for the Success case first.\
  a. First we add a name to this logic\
  b. Then click on `+ Add mapping set`
