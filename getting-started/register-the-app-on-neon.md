# ðŸ¦š Register the app on Neon

1. The first step is to register your application to the Black-Panther portal. \
   [https://black-panther.prod.navi-tech.in/](https://black-panther.prod.navi-tech.in/) .\
   \
   You need to have a keycloak account to access the portal (the same credentials you use to access ops-portal).
2. On the landing page, you'll see all the applications to which you are allowed to contribute into along with a card with which you can add/register your application to the portal.
3. Clicking on the card will open a pop-up, asking information related to your portal. Right now, you only have to enter the name of the application (_recommended pattern is UPPER\_CASE\_WITH\_UNDESCORE)._
4. You can also add the keycloak usernames of the developers/stakeholders involved with your application and they will also be given access to your application and it's page configurations.
5. Completing that completes your application registration with Neon.
